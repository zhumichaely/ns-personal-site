        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>
          My name is Michael Zhu. I'm currently a second-year student at The
          Ohio State University studying Computer Science and Engineering, and
          plan to graduate some time in the next two years.
        </p>
        <p>
          I switched majors as I entered college and as a result am considerably
          new to the field, but learning quickly. Right now I'm simply trying to
          gain experience working with different technologies and making
          different things.
        </p>
        <p>
          Outside of computer science I'm enthusiastic about fitness and video
          games. My other interests change very often, so the best way to know
          about them is to ask me!
        </p>

      <div id="siteinfo" class="section">
        <h3>About This Website</h3>
        <p>
          I built this website in order to showcase some things I learned how to
          do with web design, as well as serve as a place to provide some
          personal insight on other projects I've done.
        </p>
        <p>
          As far as the showcasing part, the site is relatively basic but can
          hopefully demonstrate that I'm able to make <i>something</i>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The page itself doesn't use any client-side framework, just
          JavaScript, so the animations and other non-basic behavior you might
          observe were all written by yours truly (do <i>not</i> append
          "/rainbow.js" to the URL: you won't like what you see). However, I do
          use the Express NPM package for a "backend" as I wanted to make this
          site non-static. It shouldn't be too hard to find out how so--that
          said, if you're reading this, you haven't.
        </p>

          At this point I'm fairly confident that you aren't on a mobile device.
          If you are, you own an impressively large tablet. Props. I tried to be
          as mobile-friendly as possible; try viewing this site on a smartphone
          to see the changes I made to do so!

          I tried to be as mobile-friendly as possible; if you'd like to see the
          elements I omitted to do so, simply visit on your computer!
        </p>
        <p>
          As for the rest of the site, there's nothing much to say. It's just a
          basic website. I was able to make the "frontend" relatively easily,
          and you can find its static version hosted on
          <a href="https://zhumichaely.github.io">GitHub Pages</a>.
        </p>

          If you've come here for my take on my other projects, simply keep
          reading!

        <h3>My Projects</h3>
        <p>
          All my projects can also be found on my GitHub. They each have a
          readme, so I figured I'd share things I learned while building them
          here, rather than reciting what can already be found there.
