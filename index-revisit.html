        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>
          My name is Michael Zhu. I'm currently a third-year student at The Ohio
          State University studying Computer Science and Engineering, and plan
          to graduate in the spring of 2023. In the meantime I'll be finishing
          up my degree requirements, studying abroad and exploring some of my
          more specific interests when it comes to the field.
        </p>
        <p>
          I switched majors as I entered college and as a result am considerably
          new to the field, but learning quickly. I've gained a little bit of
          experience over my first half of undergraduate study, but there is
          still just as much for me to pick up on now as there was on day one.
        </p>
        <p>
          Outside of computer science I'm quite enthusiastic about music and
          sports. I've played an instrument for much, much more of my life than
          not, and also enjoy listening to those more talented than me. When it
          comes to sports, although my athletic glory days are over, I similarly
          love to watch the professionals and see what I could have been if I
          had just been a foot taller, 50 pounds heavier and twice as strong.

        <h3>About This Website</h3>
        <p>
          I built this website in order to demonstrate some competence when it
          comes to web design, as well as provide some personal insight on other
          projects I've done.
        </p>
        <p>
          As far as the demonstrating part, the site is relatively basic but
          should serve as sufficient proof that I'm able to make
          <i>something</i>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The page itself doesn't use any client-side framework--just vanilla
          JavaScript--so the animations and other non-skeletal behavior you
          might observe were all written by yours truly, manually. However, I do
          use the Express NPM package on the server side. I wanted to
          distinguish this site as non-static (competence!), and I can think of
          many things I'd rather do than handle the boilerplate involved with
          raw HTTP requests. It shouldn't be too hard to find out how I treat
          different users differently, and if you're reading this, there's a
          chance you already have (hint: scroll up).
        </p>
        <p>
          This site is secure. Though there is no opportunity for you to somehow
          divulge your credit card information here, the peace of mind is nice,
          isn't it? No one at the airport can eavesdrop on what you're doing
          here--you can browse shame-free! I mention this not because having
          Transport Layer Security is particularly impressive, but because there
          is a particularly impressive amount of sites that don't. A scary
          amount of the servers run by my own school have a deprecated
          implementation or no encryption at all. A basic, modern certificate is
          free in cost and nearly free in time to acquire!

          At this point I'm fairly confident that you aren't on a mobile device.
          If you are, you own an impressively large tablet. Props. I tried to be
          as mobile-friendly as possible; try viewing this site on a smartphone
          to see how I did!

          As for the rest of the site, there's nothing much to say. It's just a
          basic website. Feel free to click through, or look at its resources if
          you're weird like that.

        <h3>My Projects</h3>
        <p>
          All my projects can be found on my GitHub. They each have a readme, so
          I figured I'd share things I learned while building them here, rather
          than reciting what can already be found there.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'll list them in chronological order, since that makes the most sense
          for a progression.
