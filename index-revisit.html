        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>
          My name is Michael Zhu. I'm currently a second-year student at The
          Ohio State University studying Computer Science and Engineering, and
          plan to graduate some time in the next two years.
        </p>
        <p>
          I switched majors as I entered college and as a result am considerably
          new to the field, but learning quickly. Right now I'm simply trying to
          gain experience working with different technologies and making
          different things.
        </p>
        <p>
          Outside of computer science I'm enthusiastic about fitness and video
          games. My other interests change very often, so the best way to know
          about them is to ask me!
        </p>

      <div id="siteinfo" class="section">
        <h3>About This Website</h3>
        <p>
          I built this website in order to showcase some things I learned how to
          do with web design, as well as serve as a place to provide some
          personal insight on other projects I've done.
        </p>
        <p>
          As far as the showcasing part, the site is relatively basic but can
          hopefully demonstrate that I'm able to make <i>something</i>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The page itself doesn't use any client-side framework, just
          JavaScript, so the animations and other non-basic behavior you might
          observe were all written by yours truly (do <i>not</i> append
          "/rainbow.js" to the URL: you won't like what you see). However, I do
          use the Express NPM package for a "backend" as I wanted to make this
          site non-static. It shouldn't be too hard to find out how so--in fact,
          if you're reading this, there's a chance you already have (hint:
          scroll up).
        </p>

          At this point I'm fairly confident that you aren't on a mobile device.
          If you are, you own an impressively large tablet. Props. I tried to be
          as mobile-friendly as possible; try viewing this site on a smartphone
          to see the changes I made to do so!
        </p>

          I tried to be as mobile-friendly as possible; if you'd like to see the
          elements I omitted to do so, simply visit on your computer!
        </p>
        <p>
          As for the rest of the site, there's nothing much to say. It's just a
          basic website. I was able to make the "frontend" relatively easily,
          and you can find its static version hosted on
          <a href="https://zhumichaely.github.io">GitHub Pages</a>.

        <h3>My Projects</h3>
        <p>
          All my projects can be found on my GitHub. They each have a readme, so
          I figured I'd share things I learned while building them here, rather
          than reciting what can already be found there.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'll list them in chronological order, since that makes the most sense
          for a progression.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>CollegeCheque</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          In my first hackathon, I used version control, the Unix command line,
          and Python for the first time. As a result of my greenness, I had the
          least responsibility of my team members and was allowed to spend a lot
          of the time learning from them, namely on how to use those three
          aforementioned tools. I also got to sleep, which was nice.
        </p>
        <p>
          While I learned many technical details, and enjoyed spending the day
          being educated and receiving rewards based on the merit of my other
          team members, I consider the realization that I was missing out on a
          limitless source of information to be the most valuable. Being aware
          that the people around me are more than willing to share their
          knowledge on various technologies will be useful forever. Though I
          treated this hackathon solely as a learning experience, in the future
          I won't have to if I leverage my resources. I'm excited to become a
          more valuable contributor in my next team.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Simon</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          In my Fundamentals of Engineering course our last assignment consisted
          of making a game adaptation of our choice for the Proteus, an in-house
          microcontroller with a touchscreen. My partner and I tried to pick a
          game that would be relatively simple and lend itself well to
          touchscreen. While I still would rather have done Cookie Clicker,
          Simon certainly wasn't a poor choice.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you're unfamiliar with Simon, you can read about it
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_(game)">here</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Although the game might be simple to play, it was less simple to
          implement than we anticipated. The Proteus library is written in C++,
          and by the end our project had gotten quite verbose. The goal was to
          make the code as modular as possible, which I assumed meant separating
          literally every task into its own method.
        </p>
        <p>
          We ended up with the shortest main method after Hello World. Looking
          over the code now, it isn't as bad as I remembered, as I believe most
          of the methods are called multiple times, but making everything a
          function didn't make maintenence that much easier, which was the real
          goal. If I were to redo the project, I'd keep that in mind. I'd also
          make Cookie Clicker instead.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>CSE 2231</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          During Spring 2020, all of our courses transitioned online. It was a
          pretty smooth process for me, since I was lucky enough to have
          instructors that genuinely cared about maintaining the quality of
          their course through the end of the semester.
        </p>
        <p>
          That said, in Software Development and Design part of the burden
          associated with transitioning was placed on the students, as we did
          pair programming in lab and completed a partner project about every
          week. Our projects consisted mostly of implementing various data
          structures in Java, and we were to use version control.
        </p>
        <p>
          While we had in-person instruction, this wasn't consequential for me
          or my partner since we always did our assignments together, so we'd be
          able to show each other our work without too much trouble. When we had
          to work together remotely, however, properly syncing our code became
          non-trivial.
        </p>
        <p>
          We'd stored all our projects in a Subversion repository that was
          hosted on the department's server. When we left campus, if we wanted
          to access the repository we would have had to connect with remote
          desktop. We elected instead to create a new one on GitHub and work out
          of there. Note that at this point I'd been exposed to Git exactly
          once, and I hadn't been involved at all in the initialization of the
          repository I contributed to.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I attempted to create our workspace I didn't include a gitignore
          at all, and it turns out Eclipse has a lot of files that only apply to
          the machine it's running on. During our first remote project my
          partner and I spent too much time to admit writing over the other's
          work. Every time one of us pulled, the paths to all the necessary
          files on our machine got replaced with the path on their machine.
          Eventually and thankfully, we realized the solution wasn't to recommit
          everything, and learned about the superpower of choosing which files
          to track. If not for that, we'd still be working now.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Reddit Bots</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm currently working on a number of Reddit bots that will parse self
          posts and comments. The repositories are currently privated, but I can
          still share some things I've improved on.
        </p>
        <p>
          Most of the function in bots is searching for certain words or words
          that match some criteria. I elected to use regular expressions a lot
          since they're concise and generally easy for someone unfamiliar with
          the code to interpret.
        </p>
        <p>
          The main problem I face is people using characters I don't anticipate.
          On many occasions a user has typed fancy apostrophes or quotes instead
          of their regular counterparts when I'm looking for words inside
          punctuation, used an accented letter when I'm looking for words that
          contain its plain version, or included non-Latin characters. I write
          everything in JavaScript, which doesn't really have a great regex
          engine, so that's the excuse I'll run with.
        </p>
        <p>
          To better process Reddit content in the future, I'll consider that
          everyone may not speak the same language or use the same devices. More
          importantly, I'll use Python instead.
        </p>
        <p>
          As of now, this is all I'm working on. Hopefully at one point you can
          revisit this website and I'll have improved it somehow. However, for
          the time being, this is it. Thanks for reading!
