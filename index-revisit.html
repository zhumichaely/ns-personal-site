        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>
          My name is Michael Zhu. I'm currently a second-year student at The
          Ohio State University studying Computer Science and Engineering, and
          plan to graduate some time in the next two years.
        </p>
        <p>
          I switched majors as I entered college and as a result am considerably
          new to the field, but learning quickly. Right now I'm simply trying to
          gain experience working with different technologies and making
          different things.
        </p>
        <p>
          Outside of computer science I'm enthusiastic about fitness and video
          games. My other interests change very often, so the best way to know
          about them is to ask me!
        </p>

      <div id="siteinfo" class="section">
        <h3>About This Website</h3>
        <p>
          I built this website in order to showcase some things I learned how to
          do with web design, as well as serve as a place to provide some
          personal insight on other projects I've done.
        </p>
        <p>
          As far as the showcasing part, the site is relatively basic but can
          hopefully demonstrate that I'm able to make <i>something</i>. The page
          itself doesn't use any client-side framework, just JavaScript, so the
          animations and other non-basic behavior you might observe were all
          written by yours truly (do <i>not</i> append "/rainbow.js" to the URL:
          you won't like what you see). However, I do use the Express NPM
          package as I wanted to make this site non-static. It shouldn't be too
          hard to find out how the page changes. In fact, if you're reading
          this, there's a chance you have already (hint: scroll up).
        </p>
        <p>
          If you've come here for my take on my other projects, simply keep
          reading!
        </p>

      <div id="projects" class="section">
        <h3>My Projects</h3>
        <p>
          All my projects can also be found on my GitHub. They each have a
          readme, so I figured I'd share things I learned while building them
          here, rather than reciting what can already be found there.
